# oxlint

- Rationale: fast linter that enforces style and catches common bugs early. Use the Vite plugin for integration.
- Installation: Install via `vite-plugin-oxlint` in Vite projects.
- Typical files: Configured in `vite.config.ts` via the `vite-plugin-oxlint` plugin.
- Agent checks: `pnpm run lint` and fail PRs on lint errors (or require autofix before merge).
