# Nitro

- Rationale: for server-side applications using Nitro. When a repo uses Nitro, include framework-specific agent checks (build + server-side rendering tests).
- For most front-end applications, Nitro will be installed as part of Nuxt and will be configured in the `nitro` entry of `nuxt.config.ts`

## When not part of Nuxt

- Typical files: `nitro.config.ts`, and `package.json` scripts.
